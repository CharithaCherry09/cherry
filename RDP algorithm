   RAMER DOUGLAS PEUCKER(RDP) algorithm:
Look at the first and last points of the line.
Draw a line between them.
Find the point that's farthest from this line.
If that point is far enough from the line, keep it.
Now, split the line into two parts at this farthest point.
Repeat steps 1-5 for both new lines.
Stop when all points are close enough to their lines.
